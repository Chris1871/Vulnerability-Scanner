This script scans a webpage for vulnerabilities. 
Currently it only scans for Cross Site Scripting (XSS) but you can add other vulns like SQL injection to the script.

These scripts were written to be run with Python3.

Only run on webpages that you have permission to run on.

Run vulnerability_scanner.py to run an instance of the scanner.py class.
- Open vulnerability_scanner.py and enter in target_url for the webpage you'd like to scan
- Enter in links_to_ignore, such as pages that would cause you to log out of your session (if you logged in in the first place)
- You can enter login credentials into data_dict.  Username and password elements may need to be changed accordingly depending on the URL 

Current target is set to my own instance of DVWA (Damn vulnerable web application, which is a web page to practice penetration testing on).
